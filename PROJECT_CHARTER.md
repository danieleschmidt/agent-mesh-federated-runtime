# Project Charter: Agent Mesh Federated Runtime

## üèôÔ∏è Project Vision

**Mission**: Enable truly decentralized AI systems through a scalable, secure, and privacy-preserving federated learning runtime.

**Vision**: To become the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of collaborative AI, where intelligent agents can work together across organizational boundaries while maintaining privacy and autonomy.
