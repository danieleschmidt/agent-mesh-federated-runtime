# Project Charter: Agent Mesh Federated Runtime

## Executive Summary
The Agent Mesh Federated Runtime project delivers a production-ready, decentralized peer-to-peer system for federated learning and multi-agent coordination, eliminating single points of failure through Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus.

## Problem Statement
Current federated learning and multi-agent systems rely on centralized coordinators, creating bottlenecks, single points of failure, and privacy vulnerabilities. Organizations need truly decentralized systems that can scale from edge devices to cloud clusters while maintaining security and fault tolerance.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Decentralized P2P mesh networking with libp2p, gRPC, WebRTC
- Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for model updates and coordination
- Dynamic role negotiation (trainer/aggregator/validator/coordinator)
- Secure aggregation with homomorphic encryption and differential privacy
- Multi-agent task distribution with capability-aware load balancing
- Cross-platform deployment (edge devices, Kubernetes, hybrid cloud)
- Real-time monitoring and observability tools

### Out of Scope
- Centralized coordination mechanisms
- Single-tenant or non-distributed deployments
- Legacy protocol support (pre-TLS 1.2)
- Vendor-specific cloud integrations

## Success Criteria

### Technical Objectives
- **Zero Central Authority**: System operates without central coordinators
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Continues operation with up to 33% malicious nodes
- **Dynamic Scalability**: Scale from 2 to 10,000+ agents seamlessly
- **Privacy Preservation**: Built-in differential privacy and secure aggregation
- **Hot Swapping**: Add/remove agents without operational interruption
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Edge devices, cloud, and hybrid deployments

### Performance Targets
- Sub-100ms message latency in optimal conditions
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent nodes
- Memory usage under 512MB for edge deployments
- 99.9% uptime in presence of node failures
- Resistance to Sybil, Eclipse, and DDoS attacks

### Quality Metrics
- 95%+ test coverage across all components
- Security audit compliance (FIPS 140-2)
- GDPR/CCPA privacy regulation compliance
- Complete API documentation with examples
- One-command deployment for standard configurations
