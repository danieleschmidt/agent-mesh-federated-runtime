# Agent Mesh Deployment Guide

## Quick Start

### Development Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

2. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh development
   ```

3. Access services:
   - Agent Mesh: http://localhost:8080
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

### Production Deployment

1. Build and tag images:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

2. Deploy to production:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh production
   ```

## Health Checks

Check system health:
```bash
./scripts/health_check.py
```

## Configuration

- Development: `configs/staging.json`
- Production: `configs/production.json`

## Architecture

The Agent Mesh system consists of:

- **Mesh Nodes**: Core P2P network participants
- **Consensus Engine**: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus
- **Federated Learner**: Distributed learning coordinator
- **Secure Aggregator**: Privacy-preserving model aggregation
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack

## Security

- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Certificate-based node authentication
- Role-based access control
- Regular security audits and logging

## Scaling

The system automatically scales based on:
- CPU and memory usage
- Network load
- Request latency
- Error rates

## Support

For support and troubleshooting, see:
- Logs: `./logs/`
- Metrics: http://localhost:9090
- Health: `./scripts/health_check.py`
