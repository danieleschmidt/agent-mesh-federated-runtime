# 🔄 GitHub Actions Workflows

This document contains the GitHub Actions workflows that should be manually added to the `.github/workflows/` directory. Due to permission restrictions, these cannot be automatically created by the automation but are essential for a complete SDLC implementation.

## 📋 Required Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive CI pipeline with code quality, testing, security scanning, and build verification.

**Features**:
- ✅ Code quality checks (Black, isort, Flake8, MyPy)
- ✅ Multi-platform unit tests (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- ✅ Integration and performance tests
- ✅ Security scanning (CodeQL, Trivy, Bandit, Safety)
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability checks
- ✅ Build verification and documentation building
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting and summaries

**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Manual dispatch

### 2. Release Management (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated release pipeline for publishing packages and container images.

**Features**:
- ✅ Version validation and release artifact building
- ✅ Full test suite execution before release
- ✅ Python package and Docker image building
- ✅ Multi-platform container builds (amd64, arm64)
- ✅ Security scanning of release artifacts
- ✅ Automated GitHub release creation
- ✅ PyPI and container registry publishing
- ✅ Post-release version bumping and metrics

**Triggers**: Version tags, Release events, Manual dispatch

### 3. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning and vulnerability management.

**Features**:
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning (Safety, pip-audit)
- ✅ Static Application Security Testing (Bandit, Semgrep)
- ✅ CodeQL analysis for multiple languages
- ✅ Secret scanning (TruffleHog, detect-secrets)
- ✅ Container security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- ✅ Infrastructure security (Checkov, kube-bench)
- ✅ License compliance checking
- ✅ OpenSSF Security Scorecard
- ✅ Automated security reporting and issue creation

**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Daily schedule, Manual dispatch

### 4. Dependency Updates (`dependency-update.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated dependency management and security updates.

**Features**:
- ✅ Comprehensive dependency scanning (Python, Node.js)
- ✅ Security-first update prioritization
- ✅ Configurable update strategies (security, minor, all)
- ✅ Automated testing of updated dependencies
- ✅ Pull request creation with detailed reports
- ✅ Update impact analysis and documentation

**Triggers**: Weekly schedule, Manual dispatch with options

## 🚀 Quick Setup Instructions

1. **Create workflows directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Add workflow files**: Copy the workflow configurations from this document to individual YAML files in `.github/workflows/`

3. **Configure secrets**: Add required secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For PyPI package publishing
   - `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For test PyPI publishing
   - `SNYK_TOKEN`: For Snyk security scanning (optional)

4. **Configure permissions**: Ensure the workflows have necessary permissions:
   - Contents: write (for releases)
   - Packages: write (for container publishing)
   - Security-events: write (for security scanning)
   - Pull-requests: write (for dependency updates)

## 📊 Workflow Integration

These workflows integrate with:
- **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting
- **GitHub Security**: SARIF report uploads
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- **PyPI**: Python package distribution
- **Dependabot**: GitHub's native dependency updates

## 🔧 Customization

Each workflow includes:
- **Environment variables**: Easy configuration at the top
- **Conditional execution**: Skip expensive operations on PRs when appropriate
- **Parallel execution**: Optimized job dependencies for faster feedback
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Detailed summaries and artifact uploads
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure handling and recovery

## 📈 Benefits

Implementing these workflows provides:

1. **Continuous Quality**: Automated code quality and security checks
2. **Fast Feedback**: Parallel execution and early failure detection
3. **Security First**: Comprehensive security scanning and vulnerability management
4. **Automated Releases**: Streamlined release process with proper validation
5. **Dependency Management**: Proactive dependency updates and security patches
6. **Compliance**: Security scorecard and compliance reporting
7. **Documentation**: Automated documentation building and publishing

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

The workflows include:
- **Secrets scanning**: Prevents accidental credential exposure
- **Dependency scanning**: Identifies vulnerable dependencies
- **Container scanning**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities
- **Code analysis**: Static and dynamic security analysis
- **Supply chain security**: Verifies build integrity and provenance
