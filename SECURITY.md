## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

The Agent Mesh Federated Runtime operates in adversarial environments with the following threat assumptions:

- **Byzantine Adversaries**: Up to 33% of network nodes may be malicious
- **Network Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle, DDoS, and partition attacks
- **Privacy Attacks**: Model inversion, membership inference, and poisoning
- **System Compromise**: Individual node compromise without network-wide impact

### Security Guarantees

1. **Confidentiality**: All inter-node communications are encrypted end-to-end
2. **Integrity**: Byzantine fault tolerance ensures data consistency
3. **Availability**: System continues operating despite node failures
4. **Privacy**: Differential privacy protects individual data contributions
5. **Authentication**: Cryptographic identity verification for all participants

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Encryption Standards

- **Symmetric Encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD)
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Curve25519 (ECDH) + Ed25519 (signatures)
- **Hash Functions**: Blake3 for general use, SHA-256 for compatibility
- **Key Derivation**: HKDF with application-specific info strings
- **Random Number Generation**: OS-provided CSPRNG with entropy pooling

### Consensus Security

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Custom PBFT implementation
- **Threshold Signatures**: BLS signatures for efficient consensus
- **Leader Election**: Cryptographically secure randomness
- **View Changes**: Timeout-based with exponential backoff

### Privacy Protection

- **Differential Privacy**: Configurable epsilon/delta parameters
- **Secure Aggregation**: Homomorphic encryption for model updates
- **Anonymous Routing**: Onion routing for metadata protection
- **Data Minimization**: Zero-knowledge proofs where applicable
