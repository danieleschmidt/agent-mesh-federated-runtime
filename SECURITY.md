# Security Policy

## üîí Security Commitment

The Agent Mesh Federated Runtime project takes security seriously. We are committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our decentralized AI platform and protecting our users' data and privacy.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
**security@your-org.com**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- **Affected components** (specific files, functions, or modules)
- **Step-by-step reproduction** instructions
- **Impact assessment** (what an attacker could achieve)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Triage**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: 90 days after fix, or sooner if agreed

## üîç Security Scope

### In Scope

The following components are within scope for security reports:

- **Core Runtime**: P2P networking, consensus algorithms
- **Federated Learning**: Model aggregation, secure computation
- **Cryptographic Components**: Key management, secure channels
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Node identity, access controls
- **Privacy Features**: Differential privacy, secure aggregation
- **API Endpoints**: gRPC and REST interfaces
- **Container Images**: Official Docker images
- **Documentation**: If it could lead to insecure implementations

### Out of Scope

- **Third-party Dependencies**: Report to upstream projects first
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting users directly
- **Physical Access**: Attacks requiring physical device access
- **DoS Attacks**: Unless they reveal underlying vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Issues related to API rate limiting

## üèÜ Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels based on CVSS 3.1:

### Critical (9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution without authentication
- Complete system compromise
- Massive data breach potential

### High (7.0-8.9)
- Remote code execution with authentication
- Privilege escalation to admin
- Significant data exposure

### Medium (4.0-6.9)
- Local privilege escalation
- Limited data exposure
- Authentication bypass

### Low (0.1-3.9)
- Information disclosure
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Low-impact DoS

## üîß Security Measures

### Development Security

- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP guidelines
- **Code Review**: All code reviewed by security-aware developers
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Secrets Management**: No secrets in code, proper secret rotation

### Runtime Security

- **Network Security**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Identity Verification**: Cryptographic node identity
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Resource Limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion

### Cryptographic Security

- **Modern Crypto**: Using current cryptographic standards
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Preparing for quantum-resistant algorithms

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Network Security

```python
# Secure channel establishment
secure_channel = SecureChannel(
    protocol="noise_xx",  # Modern cryptographic protocol
    local_key=node_keypair,
    verify_peer=True,
    perfect_forward_secrecy=True
)
```

### Identity Management

```python
# Cryptographic node identity
identity = IdentityManager()
keypair = identity.generate_ed25519_keypair()
certificate = identity.create_x509_certificate(
    keypair=keypair,
    validity_days=365,
    extensions=["digitalSignature", "keyEncipherment"]
)
```

### Access Control

```python
# Role-based access control
rbac = RBACController()

@rbac.require_permission("federated_learning:participate")
async def join_training_round(node, model_update):
    await node.submit_update(model_update)
```

### Privacy Protection

```python
# Differential privacy
dp_engine = DifferentialPrivacy(
    mechanism="gaussian",
    epsilon=1.0,  # Privacy budget
    delta=1e-5,
    clipping_threshold=1.0
)

private_gradients = dp_engine.add_noise(gradients)
```

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logging

We log security-relevant events:

- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization decisions
- Cryptographic operations
- Network connection events
- Consensus protocol messages
- Model update submissions

### Metrics

Security metrics we track:

- Failed authentication rate
- Suspicious network activity
- Consensus protocol anomalies
- Resource utilization patterns
- Privacy budget consumption

### Alerting

Automated alerts for:

- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual network traffic patterns
- Consensus protocol violations
- Resource exhaustion attempts
- Cryptographic failures
