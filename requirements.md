# Requirements Specification

## Problem Statement
Current federated learning and multi-agent systems suffer from single points of failure and centralized bottlenecks. There's a critical need for a truly decentralized runtime that enables autonomous agent coordination without central authority.

## Success Criteria
- **Zero Central Authority**: No single coordinator required for system operation
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating with up to 33% malicious nodes
- **Dynamic Scalability**: Seamlessly scale from 2 to 10,000+ agents
- **Privacy Preservation**: Built-in differential privacy and secure aggregation
- **Hot Swapping**: Add/remove agents without interrupting operations
- **Cross-Platform**: Support edge devices, cloud, and hybrid deployments

## Functional Requirements

### Core System (Priority: Critical)
- **FR1**: P2P mesh networking with libp2p, gRPC, and WebRTC protocols
- **FR2**: Dynamic role negotiation (trainer/aggregator/validator)
- **FR3**: Byzantine consensus for model updates and coordination
- **FR4**: Secure aggregation with multiple cryptographic backends
- **FR5**: Differential privacy mechanisms with configurable parameters

### Federated Learning (Priority: High)
- **FR6**: Support for FedAvg, SCAFFOLD, FedProx aggregation strategies
- **FR7**: Heterogeneous model architecture support

### Agent Coordination (Priority: High)
- **FR10**: Task distribution with capability-aware load balancing
- **FR11**: Emergent coordination through stigmergic mechanisms
- **FR12**: Contract Net Protocol for collaborative task execution
- **FR13**: Resource-aware scheduling and optimization

### Security & Privacy (Priority: Critical)
- **FR14**: End-to-end encryption for all communications
- **FR15**: Identity management and certificate-based authentication
- **FR16**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **FR17**: Audit logging and security event monitoring

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR1**: Sub-100ms message latency in optimal network conditions
- **NFR2**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent nodes
- **NFR3**: Memory usage under 512MB for edge deployments
- **NFR4**: 99.9% uptime in presence of node failures

### Security
- **NFR5**: Resistance to Sybil, Eclipse, and DDoS attacks
- **NFR6**: Compliance with GDPR and CCPA privacy regulations
- **NFR7**: Cryptographic algorithms meet FIPS 140-2 standards

### Usability
- **NFR8**: One-command deployment for common configurations
- **NFR9**: Real-time monitoring dashboard with Grafana integration
- **NFR10**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples

### Reliability
- **NFR11**: Automatic recovery from network partitions
- **NFR12**: Graceful degradation under resource constraints
- **NFR13**: Data consistency guarantees through consensus
